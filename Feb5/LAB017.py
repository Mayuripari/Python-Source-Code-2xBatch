# datatype None
# None means nothing - None is used to initialise string. No memory will be taken
# None is not default value
# None is also not empty string.
# None is not same as False
# None is not 0

val = None
print(val)
print(type(val))  # NoneType

# In python, nothing called as null
# empty string also takes memory but not by None
name1 = ''      # it will take memory-empty string
name2 = None    # it won't take memory
